It is also used by professionals in many other contexts such as tools build control and management, dynamic data pipelines and backend web development. It is easy to pick up for anyone who has some previous coding experience. It is also used in the early UTG courses with PixelPad so it is likely familiar to many of you!

    "## Getting Help\n",
    "\n",

    "### Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with Googling the question and mentioning the library you want to use such as pandas.  For example 'how to groupby multiple columns with pandas'.  Sometimes you will get a blog post, but often this will take you to a related Stack Overflow Q&A, or access Stack Overflow directly.  As of this writing there were [204,733](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pandas) questions with the pandas tag.\n",
